# Student-Performance-Prediction
Problem Statement- How can we optimize the course structure to improve both course completion rates and overall learning outcomes, considering the performance of both course completers and dropouts?

Introduction
- MOOCs are a rapidly growing and immensely popular method of learning.
- They stand apart from traditional teaching by incorporating visuals, videos, and interactive elements to enhance engagement.
- Online platforms allow for data collection on student interactions and behavior, enabling early predictions of course completion.
- Early predictions empower course modifications and adjustments to improve completion rates.
- Our approach involves analyzing extensive student data to identify key factors contributing to course completion.
- The data drives the training of predictive models that successfully forecast course outcomes.
- We believe these successful models can significantly enhance the teaching and learning experience.

Objective- Students Performance Prediction in Online Courses using ML Algorithms. How can universities improve MOOC completion rates?
